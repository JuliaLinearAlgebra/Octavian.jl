This is done (M/Mᵣ * K/Kc * N/Nᵣ) times and the cost per is (Mᵣ/W * Nᵣ).\nCost of moving strips from B pack from the low cache levels to the highest cache levels when multiplying Aₚ * Bₚ. This is done (M / Mc * K / Kc * N / Nc) times, and the cost per is proportional to (Kc * Nᵣ). α is the proportionality-constant parameter.\nCost of packing A. This is done (M / Mc * K / Kc * N / Nc) times, and the cost per is proportional to (Mc * Kc). β is the proportionality-constant parameter.\n\nAs W is a constant, we multiply the cost by W and absorb it into α and β. We drop it from the description from  here on out.\n\nIn the full problem, we would have Lagrangian, with μ < 0: f((Mc,Kc,Nc),(μ₁,μ₂,μ₃,μ₄,μ₅)) MKN/Kc + α * MKN/Mc + β * MKN/Nc - μ₁(Mc - M) - μ₂(Kc - K) - μ₃(Nc - N) - μ₄(McKc - L2) - μ₅(KcNc - L3)\n\n0 = ∂L/∂Mc = - α * MKN / Mc² - μ₁ - μ₄*Kc\n0 = ∂L/∂Kc = - MKN / Kc² - μ₂ - μ₄*Mc - μ₅*Nc\n0 = ∂L/∂Nc = - β * MKN / Nc² - μ₃ - μ₅*Kc\n0 = ∂L/∂μ₁ = M - Mc\n0 = ∂L/∂μ₂ = K - Kc\n0 = ∂L/∂μ₃ = N - Nc\n0 = ∂L/∂μ₄ = L₁ₑ - Mc*Kc\n0 = ∂L/∂μ₅ = L₂ₑ - Kc*Nc\n\nThe first 3 constraints complicate things, because they're trivially solved by setting M = Mc, K = Kc, and N = Nc. But this will violate the last two constraints in general; normally we will be on the interior of the inequalities, meaning we'd be dropping those constraints. Doing so, this leaves us with:\n\nFirst, lets just solve the cost w/o constraints 1-3\n\n0 = ∂L/∂Mc = - α * MKN / Mc² - μ₄*Kc\n0 = ∂L/∂Kc = - MKN / Kc² - μ₄*Mc - μ₅*Nc\n0 = ∂L/∂Nc = - β * MKN / Nc² - μ₅*Kc\n0 = ∂L/∂μ₄ = L₁ₑ - Mc*Kc\n0 = ∂L/∂μ₅ = L₂ₑ - Kc*Nc\n\nSolving:\n\nMc = √(L₁ₑ)*√(L₁ₑ*β + L₂ₑ*α)/√(L₂ₑ)\nKc = √(L₁ₑ)*√(L₂ₑ)/√(L₁ₑ*β + L₂ₑ*α)\nNc = √(L₂ₑ)*√(L₁ₑ*β + L₂ₑ*α)/√(L₁ₑ)\nμ₄ = -K*√(L₂ₑ)*M*N*α/(L₁ₑ^(3/2)*√(L₁ₑ*β + L₂ₑ*α))\nμ₅ = -K*√(L₁ₑ)*M*N*β/(L₂ₑ^(3/2)*√(L₁ₑ*β + L₂ₑ*α))\n\nThese solutions are indepedent of matrix size. The approach we'll take here is solving for Nc, Kc, and then finally Mc one after the other, incorporating sizes.\n\nStarting with N, we check how many iterations would be implied by Nc, and then choose the smallest value that would yield that number of iterations. This also ensures that Nc ≤ N.\n\nNiter = cld(N, √(L₂ₑ)*√(L₁ₑ*β + L₂ₑ*α)/√(L₁ₑ))\nNblock, Nrem = divrem(N, Niter)\nNblock_Nrem = Nblock + (Nrem > 0)\n\nWe have Nrem iterations of size Nblock_Nrem, and Niter - Nrem iterations of size Nblock.\n\nWe can now make Nc = Nblock_Nrem a constant, and solve the remaining three equations again:\n\n0 = ∂L/∂Mc = - α * MKN / Mc² - μ₄*Kc\n0 = ∂L/∂Kc = - MKN / Kc² - μ₄*Mc - μ₅*Ncm\n0 = ∂L/∂μ₄ = L₂ₑ - Mc*Kc\n\nyielding\n\nMc = √(L₁ₑ)*√(α)\nKc = √(L₁ₑ)/√(α)\nμ₄ = -K*M*N*√(α)/L₁ₑ^(3/2)\n\nWe proceed in the same fashion as for Nc, being sure to reapply the Kc * Nc ≤ L₂ₑ constraint:\n\nKiter = cld(K, min(√(L₁ₑ)/√(α), L₂ₑ/Nc))\nKblock, Krem = divrem(K, Ki)\nKblock_Krem = Kblock + (Krem > 0)\n\nThis leaves Mc partitioning, for which, for which we use the constraint Mc * Kc ≤ L₁ₑ to set the initial number of proposed iterations as cld(M, L₁ₑ / Kcm) for calling split_m.\n\nMbsize, Mrem, Mremfinal, Mblocks = split_m(M, cld(M, L₁ₑ / Kcm), StaticInt{W}())\n\nNote that for synchronization on B, all threads must have the same values for Kc and Nc. K and N will be equal between threads, but M may differ. By calculating Kc and Nc independently of M, this algorithm guarantees all threads are on the same page.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"internals/#Octavian.split_m-Tuple{Any,Any,Any}","page":"Internals (Private)","title":"Octavian.split_m","text":"split_m(M, Miters_base, W)\n\nSplits M into at most Miters_base iterations.
